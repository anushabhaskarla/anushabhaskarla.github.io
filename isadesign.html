        <h1><b>ISA DESIGN GUIDE</b></h1>
        <p>During my time as the Indiana University Indian Student Association's Graphic Designer, I realized that there was a lack of foundation for graphic designers to contribute to a uniform brand. I decided that it would be beneficial to develop a design standard for the organization. With this new standard in place, the organization can begin its journey towards a stronger brand with uniform design. This interactive design book allows ISA Graphic Designers to have a quick an easily navigable resource to inspire their designs. </p>
        <p><b>Design Tools:</b> Adobe Experience Design, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop</p>
            </div>
    
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This design book includes many aspects, starting with an overview of each of the artifacts that a graphic designer for the organization would need to familiar with. It also includes a guide to the dimensions under which the designer would need to adhere to in order to maintain a consistent aesthetic that would seamlessly integrate with all of the platforms on which ISA shares its content. <br> One of the more important sections of the brandbook is located in the brand overview and design approach methodology overviews - which allows the designer to familiarize themselves with the image of the organization. Finally, the book includes some design samples that give visual examples to the designer.  </p>
