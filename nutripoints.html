                    <p>PROJECT: App Design | DATE: November 2018 | Tools: Figma | UW HCDE Program</p>
            
             
                   <br/> <br/> 
                    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                    
                    <p>Without understanding the need for nutritional prioritization, it can be difficult for teenagers to manage their academic and family commitments without sacrificing their health. NutriPoints is a food education program aimed at young teens, especially those facing food insecurity. The goal of the application is to give teens the opportunity to earn credit towards free or discounted meals through playing games and learning about nutrition.</p>

                <br/>
                 <h1> PLAY</h1>
                <h2>SELECT A GAME</h2>
                    <p >Users can select from one of many games in order to earn points. Each game provides gamified learning related to important nutritional knowledge and background that young teens should have. </p> <br/>
                
                <h2>GAME PLAY/RESULTS</h2>
                 <p >When the user selects and completes a game, they will be able to view their game play results statistics. This includes the number of points they have earned during the game, which they can then use towards healthy meals and ingredients local grocery stores and participating restaurants.</p> <br/>
                
                <br/> 
                
                
                <h1> SPEND</h1>
                <h2>GROCERY</h2>
                    <p >NutriPoints focuses on grocery, instead of restaraunts, in order to encourage users to develop economical and sustainable healthy food habits. Here, users can quickly see how many calories per serving in each item, as well as how many servings in one item. </p> <br/>
                
                <h2>RESTAURANTS</h2>
                 <p >Users also have the option to spend their points at local participating restaurants that offer healthy menu options. The number of points required to redeem a restaurant item is significantly higher than grocery items, incentivizing users to shop groceries over take out.</p> <br/>
                
                 <h2>MACROS + NUTRITION FACTS</h2>
                 <p >When the user selects a food item, they can see the macros, nutritional facts, as well as meal ideas. These functionalities further educate students in learning what's in the food their eating, as well as how they can use groceries for healthy, affordable, and filling meals. <br/><br/> All grocery and restaurant items offered through NutriPoints allow users to readily access the nutritional facts through the app before redeeming an item. This allows students to apply the knowledge they learn in the game play environment to make healthy food choices. </p> <br/>
                
                <br/><br/> 
                
                <h1>UX CHALLENGES AND TAKEAWAYS</h1>
                 <p> This project was a great way for me to get more exposure to designing to solve complex problems. I had to work on empathetic design, and truly put myself in the shoes of the users, identifying the motivating factors that would lead to healthier eating. Something I would like to work on futher with this project is to do more research and qualify my design decisions with a solidified understanding of the problem space. I enjoyed expirimenting with the use of minimalistic and clean design, while also making the application look engaging for young students by using brighter colors. Look below to see the full prototype hosted on Figma! </p>
