                    <p> Without understanding the need for nutritional prioritization it can be difficult for food insecure teenagers to manage their academic and family commitments without sacrificing their health. NutriPointsis a food education program is aimed at young teens, especially those facing food insecurity. The goal of the application is to give teens the opportunity to earn credit towards free or discounted meals through playing games and learning about nutrition.  </p>

                <h1>UX Challenges and Takeaways</h1>
                 <p> This project was a great way for me to get more exposure to Figma, as well as work on a PC laptop for the first time when designing. I enjoyed expirimenting with the use of minimalistic and clean design, while also making the application look engaging for young students by using brighter colors. Look below to see the full prototype hosted on Figma.com! </p>
