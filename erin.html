                    <h1><b>ERIN</b></h1>
                    <p>During my time as the Indiana University Indian Student Association's Graphic Designer, I realized that there was a lack of foundation for graphic designers to contribute to a uniform brand. I decided that it would be beneficial to develop a design standard for the organization. With this new standard in place, the organization can begin its journey towards a stronger brand with uniform design. This interactive design book allows ISA Graphic Designers to have a quick an easily navigable resource to inspire their designs. </p>
                    <p><b>Design Tools:</b> Adobe Experience Design, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This design book includes many aspects, starting with an overview of each of the artifacts that a graphic designer for the organization would need to familiar with. It also includes a guide to the dimensions under which the designer would need to adhere to in order to maintain a consistent aesthetic that would seamlessly integrate with all of the platforms on which ISA shares its content. <br> One of the more important sections of the brandbook is located in the brand overview and design approach methodology overviews - which allows the designer to familiarize themselves with the image of the organization. Finally, the book includes some design samples that give visual examples to the designer.  </p>
    
                <br/><br/>
        
                <h2>Material Overviews</h2>=
                <p class="contentdescrip"> Material overviews introduce the designer to the various design deliverables that they will need to create during their time as graphic designer at the Indian Student Association. These overviews include a short description of the design deliverable, tips and tricks to mastering the creation of such artifacts, as well as important elements that must be included in the deliverable in order for it to be suitable for public release. </p>

                <h2>Dimension Guide</h2>
                <p class="contentdescrip"> In order to ensure that all designs and marketing materials are ready for proper use, I created the following dimension guide to help new designers stay consistent. It is important for all materials to follow the dimension guide lines so that designs are clean, easy for the organization to use, and consistent throughout the year.</p>

                <h2>The ISA Brand</h2>
                <p>ISA has a very bright and colorful brand, as it incorporates many elements of South Asian culture. Designs created should reflect our brand, and incorporate elements of the culture elements relfected in our events. Our brand is very inclusive of people from all backgrounds. Through the use of graphics, we want to include and educate others about our culture and what we stand for. The designs realted to our organization should help viewers connect to the roots upon which our organization is built - South Asian Culture. </p>
    
                <br/><br/>
        
                <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
        
                <p>Designers are encouraged to focus on the color scheme as one of the pivotal elements of the process. Coordinate with the Event Chairs to understand any thematic elements that they would like to see reflected in the event marketing. Present many iterations of the design to organization's leadership, and make sure designs are created in a dynamic way that allows for quick and simple changes. </p>
    
                <br/><br/>
        
                <h2>Design Samples</h2>
        
                <p>Below are some examples of designs created for major events by the previous ISA graphic designers. As you can see, designs are quite unique and different from each other. Feel free to be creative and think outside of the box during the design process!</p>
