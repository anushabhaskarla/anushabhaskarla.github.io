                    <p align="left">I began my process with some research to further understand the problem space. In order to conduct research, I did some exploring of the format of orientation programs from various schools and also reached out to some students who have been through the orientation experience. <br/><br/>

                        In order to familiarize myself with common features for applications about events, I looked to Eventbrite as well as beInvolved, a platform used by some universities for student organizations and events.

                    <p align="left">
                        With my research, I was able to identify some key User Problems and Goals <br/><br/>
                        
                        1. Orientation events information is not integrated across all university departments, making it hard to find<br/><br/>

                        2. Students have obligations to attend required orientation events <br/><br/>

                        3. The orientation timeline is dense and busy for students <br/><br/>

                        4. Students have some key orientation goals (make friends, become comfortable with college environment, feel confident navigating campus)</p>

                        <br/>
                        <p>The main goal of the orientation team is to make orientation an easy and enjoyable experience for students. Based on the user problems I was able to identify, personalization, and making the orientation process easy to navigate the main goals of this project. </p>

                        The icons used for this application are from Material Design icon kit. This application was designed using the Material Design standards.<br/><br/>

                        So, why an app? <br/><br/>

                        Since the target user of this application will be busy and on the go, they will need to be able to access this information without their computers. In addition, with the use of an app, students can enable reminders and notifications, which will further assist them during their busy schedules. <br/><br/><br/></p>

                       <br/>

                        <b>Login Process</b><br/><br/>
                        Students have the opportunity to log into their Centrally Authenticated university account. By accessing central authentication, the app will gain access to the student’s basic university information, such as their department and assigned orientation group. This information will allow the app to present students with personalized information, such as showing them department specific events, and alerting them events that they are required to go to based on their student status. <br/><br/>
                        
                        Upon login, users are also encouraged to take a preferences quiz where the application can gather data on their interests in order to match them up with appropriate events while they are browsing and searching. It also allows users to configure some of the application settings and notifications as a part of the onboarding process.

                        <b> Browse (For You) </b><br/><br/>
                      
                        In the browse screen users get to see “Top Picks”, which are generated using their activity preferences and other activity in the app (such as RSVP-ing or liking events). When logging into the app, the user is able to quickly and easily see events that are most relevant to them, making it easier to find events that they would like to attend. <br/><br/>

                        There is also a list-by-date below Top Picks, where users can see event programming for the following days, and also use categorical chips to filter the list. Events from all university departments and campus organizations are included. </p>

                        Trending events are ranked by the number of people who have “liked” the event. With this tool, users will be able to see what kinds of events are popular. Often when making the decision to attend an event, people like to know if other people will be attending as well. By adding the trending view, the app becomes more social in nature, and helps users find situations that fulfill their social goals when first starting college.  <br/><br/>

                        Another way that users can find events is through using the Event Finder search tool. With this tool, users have the opportunity to conduct a “blind search” at the top by using the search bar. This tool will smart-suggest with a drop down based on what the user types in. <br/><br/>

                        For users who are looking for a suggestion based search, they have the opportunity to filter by various criteria in order to find events that suit their needs and preferences. This search tool will access events all across campus, including departmental and administrative events, making the student’s searching experience stress free.

                        <p align="left"><b> View Event </b><br/><br/>
                      
                        In the event details page, there is more in-depth description of the event. Another feature is iff the user’s social profile is active, they can see which people from their orientation groups, as well as which of their dorm mates are attending the event. <br/><br/>

                        This page also allows users to open the event location in Google Maps if they need help in navigating to the destination, which helps users who are unfamiliar with campus. Below the event details, the app provides more suggestions on events similar to this one that the user might also be interested in, furthering the personalized event finding experience that the application is trying to provide for the user.

                        <p align="left"><b> My Events </b><br/><br/>
                      
                            The my events page is where users can see all of the upcoming events in a “schedule” view. With this tool, they can see which events are required, as well as the time and place of each event. The cards also have a direct mapping feature built into them, so if a user is on the go and checking their application to see where they need to go, all they need to do is click on the map icon to open a route in Google Maps. <br/><br/>

                            Events can also be viewed in a list, where the format follows that of a timetable. This is ideal for students who prefer to visualize their scheduling commitments through a timeline or timetable.

                    <p align="left">
                        In my opinion, there is a significant amount of potential that is untapped in an application like this. With sufficient research and user testing, applications that help students manage their orientation schedules could be incredibly helpful. A future oriented goal for an application like this could be to adapt its use to a longer term. Perhaps, students can use an application like this to continue to find events throughout their college careers, or it could be used to manage extracurricular commitments.<br/><br/> 

                        An additional features that could be interesting to build further is the social aspect. Although there is some social influence on this application, orientation is an incredibly social time for students. If students could meet others from their majors and classes during orientation week, it will give them a sense of comfort as they start classes. <br/><br/> 

                        Something that could be incredibly helpful to users is to increase the focus on mapping functionality and navigation. Finding your way through campus can be one of the hardest things of being a new student, and it can take months for some people to truly feel comfortable with navigation. Strengthening navigation tools in order to help students learn can be a great goal for the orientation team to consider.<br/><br/>
