                    <h1>King County Metro Challenge</h1>
                    <p>PROJECT: App Design | DATE: June 2019 | Tools: Figma | UW HCDE Program (Designing for Behavior Change)</p>
            
             
                   <br/> <br/> 
                    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
                    
                    <p>During the HCDE course "Designing for Behavior Change, students were given a prompt and persona to design a product that encouraged a desired behavior change in the persona. For this project, we were working on project for King County Metro, and were challenged to encourage our persona to use alternative methods of transportation instead of driving. </p><br/>
                    
                    <h2>PERSONA</h2>
                    <p>Our persona, Fred, recently started a new job. He delivers good results, but find it hard to mesh with his colleagues. Some defining characteristics of Fred is that he is concered about what others think of him, likes high-end clothing brands, and doesn't know how to update his phone (his sister shows him the new apps he should use).</p>
                    <br/>
                    
                    <h2>GOALS</h2>
                    <p><b>KCM'S goal</b> is to encourage the use of alternative modes of transport instead of driving. <br/><br/> <b>Fred's goal</b> is to get to work on time, well dressed,  with his coffee in hand. He also would like to develop new relationships with co-workers at his job.</p><br/> 
                    
                    <h2>BARRIERS</h2>
                    <p>Before we got started on ideating, we identified some potential barriers that Fred would face - demotivating him to change his behaviors. <br/><br/> 1. Fred is familiar with driving to work, and unfamiliar with using public transport in Seattle (to get to work, and in general) <br/>2. Fred tends to run late when leaving the house (and thus, perceives a need for the convenience of using his car or does not want to risk missing the bus). <br/> 3. Lacks awareness of the benefits of taking public transport <br/> 4. Fred doesn't know what to do on the bus, as his attention was previously occupied by the road.</p><br/>

                    <h2>ONBOARDING</h2>
                    <p>In these onboarding screens, certain features of the app that will motivate Fred to enroll are highlighted. For example, the onboarding screens show that many of Fred's coworkers use the app, and that Fred can work together and interact with his co-workers as he uses public transport. Since developing stronger relationships with his co-workers is a major goal of Fred's, the onboarding process zeroes in on this element of his persona. These onboarding screens also reflect the social and fun aspects of the app, making it appealing to people who don't fall into Fred's specific characteristics.
                    
                    <br/><br/> The onboarding process also previews the features of the app, allowing users with lower tech literacy to have an idea of what to expect once they have set up an account.</p><br/>

                   <h2>TUTORIAL</h2>
                    <p>The app provides the user with a tutorial upon first login. This allows users to understand how the app works, and how they can contribute to their team's points. Since the way the app works is unique, giving users an understanding of what they need to do to start using it is very important, espcially for users like Fred with low tech literacy. </p><br/>

                    <h2>FIRST RIDE</h2>
                    <p>In order to address the barrier of lack of knowledge regarding public transport, the KCM app incentivizes the user to get the help they need with setting up their daily route. Users can plan their daily commute from home by selecting a type of transport, departure time, and more.  In Fred's case, this is adressing both his lack of knowlege of the public transportation system, as well as his need to get to his new job on time and continue to make a good impression.</p><br/>

                    <h2>REAL TIME INTERACTION</h2>
                    <p>After a confirmed plan is provided to the user, they will get time and location based reminders of when to leave in order to successfully take the public transport of their choice. In this example, Fred, who is taking the bus, will know when to leave his house to go to the bus stop, and also know how long to wait for the bus once he arrives. The time and location based intearction continues when the user is on the bus, where a real-time points feed will allow riders to stay engaged during their rides, and also allow them to see the progress and contributions of their teammates. </p><br/>

                    <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
                    <p>In order to engage users overtime, the app includes challenges that users can particpate in over time. Challenges can be generated by the app to incentivize group usage, such as going out to lunch together while using public transporation to travel there. Users can also send and receive challenges to other members in their tieam, increasing the personalization of the social interaction, and allowing users to generate their own content that keeps them interested in using the application. For a user like Fred, this allows him to make personal connections with team members, and also use the social challenges as an excuse to participate in group bonding amongst co-workers. Points gained through completing challenges can be redeemed as a team for discounts group activities and more. </p><br/>

                    <h1>UX CHALLENGES + TAKEAWAYS</h1>
                    <p>Designing an application with behavior change theory in mind put a very interesting perspective on the design process. This project taught me how important it is to make sure that all design decisons are driven by the needs of the user or business. I really enjoyed learning more about behavior change theory, and how theoretical UX concepts can be adapted into real products. I also was able to design for a very specific persona for the first time, and had to balance the needs of the specific persona that I was assigned to create a product for, while also assessing if the implemented features would be beneficial for the general user base.  </p>
