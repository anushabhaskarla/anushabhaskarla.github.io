<h1>INDIAN STUDENT ASSOCIATION</h1>
    
    <p>As the Graphic Designer of the Indian Student Association of Indiana University, I was tasked with creating various marketing materials for the organizations events. These events were marketed towards a large audience, and drew up anywhere from 50 to 400 individuals. The design of all marketing was incredibly important, as the organization had been faced with falling attendance for events.
    
        Going into this position, I wanted to make some changes to the way that the Graphic Design position interacted with the rest of the organization. Instead of functioning in a silo, I made it a point to interact with other board members and prospective event attendees to get an understanding of what kind of design appeals to our audience. By using a thoroughly <a href="isadesign.html"> outlined design approach </a> that I created, I was able create graphics that sparked interest while also contributing to the creation of the organization's brand. Below are some samples of work from my time in the position. Hover over the images to learn more about the design! </p>

        <div class="overlay"><div class="text"><p><b>Garba</b> <br><br>I incorporated bright colors to honor the rich culture of Gujrat. The goal of this graphic was to be eye catching, and ideal for print and paper marketing. The goal was to ensure that the poster stands out to a passerby walking down a hallway. Another key point is the incorporation the 'die cut' Garba dancers that embody the nature of the event.</p></div></div>

        <div class="overlay"><div class="text"><p><b>Call Out Meeting</b> <br><br>The fonts in the graphic bring out the "school" aspect of our organization, bringing culture and college together. The key point of this design includes a henna printed elephant to emphasize the cultural aspect of the organization. In addition, the organization logo is larger than usual in order to draw attention to the ISA brand as this is the first event of the year.</p> </div></div>
